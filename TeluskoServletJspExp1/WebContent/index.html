	Hello World!
<p>	You can Either Override a Service method or doGet,doPost Method. 
     	The reason for writing in doPost instead of service is because on clients end 
		we can change the method(get/post) from Inspect(ctrl+shft+i) in browser and get our required method say get where data is exposed in url. 
		so we can limit such things using doGet,  doPost methods where we are allowing only the corresponding methods. We can use <b> Dispatcher Servlet</b> if both servlet are in same
		website. If you are dealing with one servlet on our website and the other on diffrent website like payment gateway
		then go fpr <b>sendRedirect</b>.
		
		Remember that in dispatcherServlet we use same req,res. But thats not the case in sendRedirect. So thats where session management
		comes in handy
		
		//Sending Data to next Servlet
		request.setAttribute("k", k);
		
		/*Can redirect from one servlet to other using 2 ways. 
		 * Request Dispatcher and SendRedirect
		 * Here wer using Request dispatcher*/
		RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("sqr");
		rd.forward(request, response);</p>
	<form action="add" method="post">  			<!-- Default is Get Method -->
		<input type="text" placeholder="Input1" name="Inp1">
		<input type="text" placeholder="Input2" name="Inp2">
		<button type="submit">Add</button>
	</form>
