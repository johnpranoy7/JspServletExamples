	<p>Servlet Config & Servlet Context.</p>
	<a href="AnotherServlet">Servlet Config: data for only one servlet</a>

	<a href="MyServlet">Servlet Context: Common data for all servlets</a>

	<br>
	<br>
	<p>-Instead of Writing servlet & servletmapping in xml we can
		simply use @WebServlet("name")</p>
	<br>
	<p>Jsp Page.</p>
	<a href="myJsp.jsp">Jsp Link</a>
	<p>Servlet can also do the same thing but the problem is we have to
		put everyting in printwrite object. so as we have lot of tags its
		confusing. so we created jsp. jsp has request,response,printwriter
		objects by default so no need to declare them again.</p>
	<p>if you want to write any java code in jsp write inside this tag
		<% %></p>
	<img alt="picnotFound" src="jspTags.png" height="500" width="900">
	<p>Three <%@ %> tags in jsp. page, include, taglib</p>
	<p>page directive is used to import packages. it also contains
		erroepage, session etc</p>
	<p>Include is used for including another jsp in this jsp</p>
	<p>
		Taglib is used for custom tags which are not available with us. For
		that we need to use
		<fx:h1> where fx is prefix and it also has uri atrribute
